Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) play games (like HTML5 Games similar to this - https://k4.games/)? If yes, how can you use concepts of computer vision to prove this and tool you need to use. 

The code provided sets up a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to play a game using reinforcement learning. Here's a breakdown of how the code works and how it plays the game:

### Components of the Code

1. **Game Environment (`GameEnv`)**:
   - **Initialization**: Sets up the action space (4 discrete actions) and observation space (84x84 grayscale image). The environment runs for a maximum of 100 steps per episode.
   - **Reset**: Resets the game to the initial state and returns the initial game screen.
   - **Step**: Takes an action, updates the game state, calculates the reward, and checks if the episode is done.
   - **Private Methods**: 
     - `_get_game_screen`: Reads and processes the game screen image.
     - `_apply_action`: Placeholder for applying the game action.
     - `_get_reward`: Returns a reward of 1 for each step survived.
     - `_check_done`: Checks if the episode has reached the maximum steps.

2. **DQN Model**:
   - A convolutional neural network (CNN) that processes the game screen and outputs Q-values for each action.

3. **Replay Memory (`ReplayMemory`)**:
   - Stores experiences `(state, action, reward, next_state, done)` to train the DQN.

4. **Training Loop**:
   - **Hyperparameters**: Set up parameters like batch size, discount factor, exploration rate, learning rate, and number of episodes.
   - **Initialization**: Creates the environment, the DQN model, and the target model. Initializes the optimizer and loss function.
   - **Episode Loop**: For each episode:
     - **Reset Environment**: Gets the initial state.
     - **Step Loop**: For each step:
       - **Action Selection**: Chooses an action using an epsilon-greedy policy.
       - **Environment Interaction**: Takes the action in the environment and observes the next state and reward.
       - **Store Experience**: Saves the experience in replay memory.
       - **Training**: If there are enough experiences, samples a batch from memory, calculates target Q-values, computes loss, and updates the model.
       - **Target Network Update**: Periodically updates the target network to match the main DQN model.
     - **Epsilon Decay**: Reduces exploration rate.

### How the Code Plays the Game

1. **Initialization**:
   - The game environment (`GameEnv`) is created.
   - The DQN model is created to approximate the Q-values for each action.
   - A target model is also created and periodically updated to stabilize training.

2. **Training Loop**:
   - For each episode, the environment is reset, and the game screen is processed.
   - For each step within an episode:
     - An action is selected using an epsilon-greedy policy (exploration vs. exploitation).
     - The environment executes the action, returning the next state, reward, and whether the episode is done.
     - The experience is stored in replay memory.
     - If there are enough experiences in memory, a batch is sampled to train the DQN:
       - The model predicts Q-values for the current states and next states.
       - Target Q-values are calculated using the rewards and the maximum Q-values from the next states.
       - The DQN model is trained to minimize the difference between its Q-value predictions and the target Q-values.
     - The target model is updated periodically to match the main model.

3. **Action Execution**:
   - During each step, the selected action is applied to the environment, which simulates the gameâ€™s response.
   - The reward is obtained based on the action's result, and the next state is captured.

4. **End of Episode**:
   - The episode ends when the maximum number of steps is reached or another termination condition is met.
   - The exploration rate (`epsilon`) is decayed to reduce random actions over time.

### Key Points

- The environment simulates a game by loading and processing game screen images.
- The DQN model learns to play the game by approximating the optimal Q-values through experience replay and target network updates.
- The training loop iteratively improves the model's performance by balancing exploration and exploitation.
- The code assumes that `game_screen.png` is available and represents the game state. This file should be dynamically updated to reflect the game's current state for each step.
